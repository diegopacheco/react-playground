STDOUT:
Perfect! I've created a complete Snake game with React that includes all the requested features:

## Features Implemented:

1. **Timer** - Displays elapsed time in MM:SS format
2. **Score** - Tracks points (10 points per food eaten)
3. **Meteor System** - Orange meteors spawn every 8 seconds that the snake must dodge
4. **Dynamic Board Expansion** - Board grows by 5 cells every 30 seconds
5. **Core Snake Mechanics** - Movement, food collection, collision detection

## Game Features:

- **Controls**: Arrow keys to control the snake
- **Visual Elements**: 
  - Green snake with glowing head
  - Red food pellets
  - Orange pulsating meteors
  - Dark themed game board
- **Stats Display**: Shows current score, time, and board size
- **Game Over Screen**: Shows final score and survival time with restart option

## Files Created:

- `src/App.jsx` - Main game logic and components
- `src/App.css` - Styling with animations
- `src/main.jsx` - React entry point
- `index.html` - HTML template
- `vite.config.js` - Vite configuration
- `package.json` - Dependencies
- `run.sh` - Launch script

## To Run:

```bash
./run.sh
```

The script will install dependencies if needed and start the development server on port 3000. The game will automatically open in your browser.
